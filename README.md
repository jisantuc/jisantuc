I'm a software engineer.

I'm interested in typed functional programming and programs that can't crash.
In non-_work_ work I like Haskell and its friends, and you can see some past small work in those areas
in [a 2d pointing satellite simulator](https://github.com/jisantuc/schedule-2d-sat-sim/),
[Advent of Code solutions](https://github.com/jisantuc/advent-of-code/tree/main/aoc2021),
and a [tiny library for explaining property-based testing](https://github.com/jisantuc/tiny-test/).

I'd like to be better at selling / teaching functional programming (e.g. [1](https://github.com/jisantuc/tiny-test/),
[2](https://github.com/jisantuc/patats/blob/master/2020-11-06-property-testing-for-fun-and-profit/property-testing-for-fun-and-profit.md))
and writing helpful docs for applications (e.g. [1](https://azavea.github.io/franklin/docs/introduction)). I'd also like to be better at
helping other people who didn't start out thinking they'd like to write software but think maybe it's for them.
