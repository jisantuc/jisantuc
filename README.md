### ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Senior Software Engineer at Azavea. I work on the [Raster Foundry](https://github.com/raster-foundry) team on
projects that touch imagery organization and analysis. Mainly right now that means
[GroundWork](https://groundwork.azavea.com/).

I'm interested in typed functional programming and programs that can't crash. In _work_ work that means Scala
for backends (where I spend most of my time), in large part because of [GeoTrellis](https://geotrellis.io/).
In non-_work_ work I like PureScript and Haskell.

I'm also a contributor to the [Spatio-Temporal Asset Catalog](https://stacspec.org/) (STAC) specification and a STAC
API server named [Franklin](https://github.com/azavea/franklin).

I'd like to be better at selling / teaching functional programming (e.g. [1](https://github.com/jisantuc/tiny-test/),
[2](https://github.com/jisantuc/patats/blob/master/2020-11-06-property-testing-for-fun-and-profit/property-testing-for-fun-and-profit.md))
and writing helpful docs for applications (e.g. [1](https://azavea.github.io/franklin/docs/introduction)). I'd also like to be better at
helping other people who didn't start out thinking they'd like to write software but think maybe it's for them.

If you want to say words to me about any of that, you can tweet at me at `@james_santucci`.
