### ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Software Engineer at [47 Degrees](https://www.47deg.com/), a global consulting firm and open source advocate specializing in Scala, Kotlin, and related functional programming technologies.

I'm interested in typed functional programming and programs that can't crash.
In non-_work_ work I like PureScript and Haskell, and you can see some past small work in those areas
in [Advent of Code solutions](https://github.com/jisantuc/advent-of-code/tree/main/aoc2021),
a [tiny library for explaining property-based testing](https://github.com/jisantuc/tiny-test/),
or work to provide a [typed functional interface for frontend development](https://github.com/jisantuc/purescript-stac)
on top of the [Spatio-Temporal Asset Catalog](https://stacspec.org/) specification. In
_work_ work, I'm just starting here, so I'll see exactly what that means ðŸ”œ.

I'd like to be better at selling / teaching functional programming (e.g. [1](https://github.com/jisantuc/tiny-test/),
[2](https://github.com/jisantuc/patats/blob/master/2020-11-06-property-testing-for-fun-and-profit/property-testing-for-fun-and-profit.md))
and writing helpful docs for applications (e.g. [1](https://azavea.github.io/franklin/docs/introduction)). I'd also like to be better at
helping other people who didn't start out thinking they'd like to write software but think maybe it's for them.

If you want to say words to me about any of that, you can tweet at me at `@james_santucci`.
